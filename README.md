In the First report I visualized the amount gained from the different countries. For this I used stacked column chart. I also wanted to know how much each region contributes to customers, so created a donut graph. I also created a list of team members in each team and a stacked bar chart that shows amount gained by  different teams. As it's visible, Team Yummies has the best total amount gained, followed by Team Delish.

In the second report I visualized the Sales Performance.
